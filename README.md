## Project Description

The Samsung Calculator clone is a web-based application that mimics the look and feel of the Samsung Calculator. This project is built purely with HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. The clone aims to be as close to the original calculator as possible, both in terms of aesthetics and behavior.

The primary objective of this project is educational. It serves as an excellent way to practice web development skills, particularly in the areas of:

- Semantic HTML structuring
- Responsive CSS design
- JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation

By working on this project, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how a real-world application is constructed from the ground up, starting with basic static HTML and CSS, and then adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The calculator is designed to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Real-time Calculation Display:** As you input numbers and operations, the display updates in real-time to show the current calculation.
- **Clear and Delete Functionality:** Includes buttons for clearing the entire input or deleting the last character.
- **Error Handling:** Properly handles division by zero and other invalid operations by displaying error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS:** Used to style the calculator, ensuring it closely resembles the Samsung Calculator app.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the functionality of the calculator, including all arithmetic operations and real-time display updates.
